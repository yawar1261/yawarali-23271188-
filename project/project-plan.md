##Title
Quantifying Market Sentiment: An In-Depth Analysis of Social Media and News Impact on Stock Prices

##Main Question
To what extent do sentiments expressed on social media and news impact stock prices?
##Description
In this project, we aim to explore the relationship between social media sentiment and news sentiment and their influence on stock prices. We'll perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of social media posts and news articles related to specific stocks and analyze their impact on stock price movements. By investigating this relationship, we aim to provide insights for investors and traders.
